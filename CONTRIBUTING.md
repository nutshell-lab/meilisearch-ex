## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://discord.com/invite/meilisearch). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/nutshell-lab/meilisearch-ex/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/nutshell-lab/meilisearch-ex/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-ex repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-ex repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/nutshell-lab/meilisearch-ex/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Elixir >= v1.14

### Setup

You can set up your local environment natively or using `docker`, check out the [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Example of running all the checks with docker:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm package bash -c "mix deps.get && mix test"
```

### Tests and Linter

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# run your Meilisearch instance
mix test
```

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Release Process

TBD.
